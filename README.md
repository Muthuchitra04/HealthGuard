HealthGuard: A Next-Gen Solution for Remote Patient Monitoring and Emergency Alerting

Abstract:
HealthGuard addresses challenges in remote healthcare by integrating sensor technology, NodeMCU microcontroller, Python analytics, and Power BI visualization to monitor crucial patient parametersâ€”pulse rate and body temperature. The system provides real-time data processing, dynamic reporting, and automated alerting for timely intervention, enhancing patient safety and well-being.

Key Features:
Real-Time Monitoring: Continuous surveillance of pulse rate and body temperature.
Dynamic Reporting: Real-time data processing and visualization using Python and Power BI.
Automated Alerting: Trigger phone calls and SMS notifications to healthcare providers in case of abnormal readings.


Technologies Used:
NodeMCU Microcontroller
Sensors: Pulse rate and body temperature sensors
Python: Data processing and analytics
Power BI: Data visualization and dashboard creation


Prerequisites:
NodeMCU: Set up the microcontroller and sensors.
Python: Install necessary libraries (pandas, matplotlib, etc.).
Power BI Desktop:


Steps:
Clone the repository

Set up the NodeMCU:
Connect the sensors to the NodeMCU.
Upload the provided firmware to the NodeMCU.

1.Run the Python script:
